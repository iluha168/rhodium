/**
 * Takes a callback of any kind (returns or throws, synchronously or asynchronously) and wraps its result in a Rhodium.
 * @param callbackFn A function that is called synchronously. It can do anything: either return a value, throw an error, or return a promise.
 * @param args Additional arguments, that will be passed to the callback.
 * @returns A Rhodium that is:
 * - Already fulfilled, if the callback synchronously returns a value.
 * - Already rejected, if the callback synchronously throws an error.
 * - Asynchronously fulfilled or rejected, if the callback returns a {@link PromiseLike promise-like}.
